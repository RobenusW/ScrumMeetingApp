# Scrum Meeting App

This was a week-long project where I created an iOS app, in Swift, where users can:
- Create reoccuring scrum meetings w/ various themes, allotated time, and attendees
- See specific details of each scrum meeting and edit such details
- Look at meeting timer showing allotated timer per speaker and providing the ability to skip speakers, if needed.
- See the history of each scrum meeting with a audio transcription of the meeting afterwords with corresponding attendees

Here are some of the photos from the Scrum Meeting App.

Note: This app is not available on iOS due to the rigorous App Store requirements. Given that this is a side project, the effort required for compliance outweighs the benefits of publishing it.
